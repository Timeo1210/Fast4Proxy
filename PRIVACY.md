# Privacy

Fast4Proxy is free software, and we deeply value your privacy, just as much as you do. We are committed to keeping your data private and only share it for options syncing purposes. Below, we have outlined all the ways we utilize user data.

### Proxy:
Fast4Proxy does not implement any proxy protocol. Instead, our role is to inform the browser about the designated proxy for each request, leaving the browser to handle the task independently. We do not modify web requests or responses in any manner, and we abstain from injecting ads or other scripts into web pages. Rest assured that we do not forward your requests to any external servers.

Please be aware that Fast4Proxy does not provide proxy servers, and we have no control over the proxies you configure. The responsibility lies with you to ensure that the chosen proxies are reliable. While using proxies, we cannot guarantee protection against tracking, ad insertion, or any potential harm. We recommend reaching out to your network or proxy server operator and reviewing their privacy policy regarding proxy usage.

### Syncing:
Fast4Proxy offers the convenience of synchronizing options across different devices. However, syncing is completely optional, and you can disable it at any time under `Options > Import/Export > Syncing`.

For syncing services, Fast4Proxy employs Chrome Sync, which facilitates data uploading to Google. It is important to note that Chrome Sync requires you to sign in to Chrome. Nevertheless, during this process, Fast4Proxy does not have access to your account information. For more details on this aspect, we advise you to review Google's Privacy Policy.
